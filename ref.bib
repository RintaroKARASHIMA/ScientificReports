  abstract = {Society 5.0 is the vision of a new human-centered society in the fifth stage launched by Japan. This paper explores a prospective model of science, technology and innovation (STI) activities in Society 5.0 from an ecosystem perspective. STI policy review and statistical analysis are conducted in comparison with Germany and the United States to describe the historical transformation of Japan's STI ecosystem. Major socio-economic risks on Japan's STI ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. Shifting from a push-based STI ecosystem to a pull-based STI ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in Society 5.0.}

  title={Technological Leadership in Industry 4.0: A Comparison Between Manufacturing and ICT Sectors Among Korean Firms},
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={28490-28505},
  abstract={This paper examines the technological structures of the manufacturing and the ICT sectors in Korea to examine the potential shift of dominant technological sectors in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). By using patent data of Korean firms from 1990 to 2021, we find that the manufacturing sector has been the dominant technological leader in Korea in terms of both the number of patents and the diversity of technologies, even in the era of 4IR. Although the ICT sector has shown an increasing focus on Industry 4.0 (I4) technologies after the 2000s, indicating the potential for a shift in dominance in the future, the gap between the two sectors is still significant. The study also reveals that the manufacturing sector tends to diversify technologies, while the ICT sector specializes in several target technologies. Our analysis also suggests that both sectors exhibit path-dependency, with the ICT sector exhibiting stronger characteristics, and firms in both sectors shows the tendency of intensive and extensive margin in their patenting activities, with the manufacturing sector exhibiting the stronger tendency.},
