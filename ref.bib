  abstract={This paper examines the technological structures of the manufacturing and the ICT sectors in Korea to examine the potential shift of dominant technological sectors in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). By using patent data of Korean firms from 1990 to 2021, we find that the manufacturing sector has been the dominant technological leader in Korea in terms of both the number of patents and the diversity of technologies, even in the era of 4IR. Although the ICT sector has shown an increasing focus on Industry 4.0 (I4) technologies after the 2000s, indicating the potential for a shift in dominance in the future, the gap between the two sectors is still significant. The study also reveals that the manufacturing sector tends to diversify technologies, while the ICT sector specializes in several target technologies. Our analysis also suggests that both sectors exhibit path-dependency, with the ICT sector exhibiting stronger characteristics, and firms in both sectors shows the tendency of intensive and extensive margin in their patenting activities, with the manufacturing sector exhibiting the stronger tendency.},

This paper explores a prospective model of science, technology and innovation (STI) activities in Society 5.0 from an ecosystem perspective. STI policy review and statistical analysis are conducted in comparison with Germany and the United States to describe the historical transformation of Japan's STI ecosystem. Major socio-economic risks on Japan's STI ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. Shifting from a push-based STI ecosystem to a pull-based STI ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in Society 5.0.}

abstract = {Abstract Although technological complexity seems to be a crucial determinant of economic development, it remains insufficiently explored. Relying on microinformation stored in individual patent applications and by applying the network view of countries linked to the technologies they develop, we create a global technology space and derive complexity measures that position countries in this space. We use then the measures of technological diversification and the ubiquity of technologies present in a country’s technology portfolio as an input to explain the role of technological complexity in countries’ income and economic development. We show that a country’s position in the global technology space affects its level of income and growth. The main channel through which it happens is the exclusiveness and uniqueness of the technological portfolio a country has, as compared to the remaining countries.},
