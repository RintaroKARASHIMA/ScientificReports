\begin{abstract}
As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. 
However, the identification is difficult because a technology is independent, and therefore it has complex nature. 
Here, this study aims to assess the patent technological fields by applying Technological Complexity Index from a corporate perspective, addressing its underutilization in Japan despite its potential. 
By utilizing carefully processed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite network which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological fields. 
Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of the ubiquity and the sophistication for each patent fields, the detailed technological trends that reflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and researchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.
